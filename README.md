# SpendWise
Application Development Project 2023

SpendWise is an easy-to-use and intuitive expense management software designed to allow users to manually input their expenses and categorize them based on their nature such as food, transportation, or entertainment. The software enables users to track their spending, manage their budget and make informed financial decisions. Moreover, SpendWise will have a savings calculator where users can easily track their spending, identify areas to cut back, and calculate how much to save each month to reach their goals. 

There is an exisiting project in github which I will building on for this project. https://github.com/ksu-is/Simple-Expense-Tracker
